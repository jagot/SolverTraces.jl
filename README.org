Small utility library for printing solver traces. Based around
[[https://github.com/JuliaIO/Formatting.jl][Formatting.jl]] and [[https://github.com/KristofferC/Crayons.jl][Crayons.jl]].

* Usage example

#+BEGIN_SRC julia
  using SolverTraces
  using Formatting
  using Crayons

  # Custom column type, needs to inherit TraceColumn and have a fmt
  # field.
  struct Random{R<:Real} <: TraceColumn
      fmt::FormatExpr
      lc::LinearColorant{R}
      header::String
  end

  Random(::Type{R}=Float64) where R =
      Random{R}(FormatExpr("{1:s}{2:9.3e}$(crayon"reset")"),
              LinearColorant(1.0, 0.0, SolverTraces.red_green_scale()),
              "   Random")

  # Also needs to be callable with current step as argument.
  function (c::Random)(i::Integer)
      n = rand()
      c.lc(n), n
  end

  num_steps = 1000
  load = 10
  trace = SolverTrace(num_steps)
  # How much load per second can be handled
  push!(trace, Performance(load))
  push!(trace, Random())

  print_header(trace)
  for i = 1:num_steps
      sleep(0.0001rand())
      SolverTraces.next!(trace)
  end
#+END_SRC

* Future ideas
  - Nested solver traces for algorithms where each step necessitates
    inner solves. It would be interesting to support such cases and
    have togglable visibility of nested traces.
  - Output to other backends than the terminal,
    e.g. HTML: asynchronous display of solver trace in the web browser
    of a computation running remotely.
